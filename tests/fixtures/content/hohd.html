<p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We need dark in order to show light. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

<p>The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>

<p>Isn't that fantastic? We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just make a decision and let it go. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

<p>In your world you can create anything you desire. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Let's build an almighty mountain. Work that paint.</p>
