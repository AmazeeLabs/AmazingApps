<p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>

<p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We have a fantastic little sky! Let's get crazy. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>

<p>Only eight colors that you need. Don't fight it, use what happens. Use what you see, don't plan it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>
