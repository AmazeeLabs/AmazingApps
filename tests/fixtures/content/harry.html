<p>There he comes. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>

<p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Don't fight it, use what happens. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.</p>

<p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's have a nice tree right here. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>

<p>A big strong tree needs big strong roots. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just a little indication. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>
