<p>You are only limited by your imagination. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. There comes a nice little fluffer. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.</p>

<p>You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Learn when to stop. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. In your world you can create anything you desire. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>

<p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.</p>

<p>If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. See there, told you that would be easy. Let's have a nice tree right here. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>
