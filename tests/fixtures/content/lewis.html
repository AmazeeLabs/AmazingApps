<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. With practice comes confidence. In your world you can create anything you desire. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>

<p>This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. What the devil. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>
