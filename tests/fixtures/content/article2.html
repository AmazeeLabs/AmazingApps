<p>When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Now then, let's play.</p>

<p>Just use the old one inch brush. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Use what you see, don't plan it. Isn't that fantastic?</p>

<p>Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You can create anything that makes you happy. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.</p>

<p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. There we go. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Put it in, leave it alone. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.</p>

<p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. We'll play with clouds today. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.</p>

<p>We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>
