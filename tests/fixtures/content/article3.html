<p>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Take your time. Speed will come later. What the devil.</p>

<p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Son of a gun. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

<p>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>

<p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can get away with a lot.</p>

<p>Anyone can paint. This piece of canvas is your world. Let the paint work. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Just a little indication. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.</p>

<p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You can do anything your heart can imagine. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.</p>
